# Building Enterprise-Grade Angular Applications

When building Angular applications for enterprise environments, there are several key considerations and best practices that can help ensure your application is scalable, maintainable, and performant.

## Architecture Patterns

In enterprise Angular applications, a well-thought-out architecture is crucial. Here are some key patterns we use at PSI Mobile:

1. **Module Organization**
   - Feature modules
   - Shared modules
   - Core module

2. **State Management**
   - NgRx for complex state
   - Services for simpler state
   - Local component state when appropriate

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading
   - Change detection strategies
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices we follow:

```typescript
// Use interfaces for type safety
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole;
}

// Implement proper error handling
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  getUser(id: string): Observable<User> {
    return this.http.get<User>(`/api/users/${id}`).pipe(
      catchError(this.handleError)
    );
  }
}
```
