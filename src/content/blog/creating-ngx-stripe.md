# The Journey of Creating ngx-stripe

ngx-stripe started as a solution to a common problem: integrating Stripe payments into Angular applications in a type-safe, Angular-friendly way.

## The Beginning

When I first needed to integrate Stripe into an Angular application, I noticed there wasn't a proper Angular library that provided:

- Type safety
- Angular-specific features
- Easy integration with Stripe Elements

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features we implemented:

```typescript
// Easy initialization
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxStripeModule.forRoot('your-publishable-key')
  ]
})

// Type-safe components
<ngx-stripe-card
  [options]="cardOptions"
  (change)="onChange($event)">
</ngx-stripe-card>
```

## Community Impact

The library has grown significantly since its initial release:

- Over 1 million downloads
- Used by thousands of developers
- Active community contributions
