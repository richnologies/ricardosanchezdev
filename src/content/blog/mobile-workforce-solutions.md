# Mobile Workforce Solutions: A Technical Deep Dive

At PSI Mobile, we specialize in building solutions that empower mobile workforces. Here's a technical look at how we approach these challenges.

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Data synchronization
   - Conflict resolution
   - Local storage strategies

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket implementations
   - Push notifications
   - Status tracking

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Battery life considerations
   - Network bandwidth optimization
   - Application size management

## Architecture Overview

Here's a simplified view of our architecture:

```typescript
// Service worker for offline support
registerServiceWorker({
  dataSyncStrategy: 'background',
  conflictResolution: 'server-wins',
  cacheStrategy: 'network-first'
});

// Real-time updates
class WorkforceService {
  private socket: WebSocket;
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializeRealTimeUpdates();
  }
  
  private initializeRealTimeUpdates() {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```
